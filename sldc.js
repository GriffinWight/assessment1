// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where a person or group gathers or lists the materials, resources, or manpower required to complete the project or development."

const design = "This is the third step. At this step in development, the proper architecture for the project is decided and implemented as the ground work."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, where the developer(s) implement actual source code into the design and the development of the software officially starts."

const tesingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step. Clearly listed in the name of the step, the software is tested and executed in order to bring the project closer to perfection and iron out any bugs that still might be around. "

const maintain = "This is the 'last' step in which the software is currently being watched and changed whenever maintenance is required or an update is to be implemented."
